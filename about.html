<p>Hi there, my name is Alexandra, but everyone calls me Lexxi. I guess my background is a bit weird for pursuing the dream to become a data scientist but however, I started off my academic career with a Bachelor in Psychology, followed by a Master in the subject "Consumer Affairs", where I worked for well-known companies in the area of Customer Experience. It was there, when I initially learnt about the emerging field of data science. While completing my Masters I started work life as a Marketing coordinator and quickly learnt that dealing with data in the marketing section was something veeeery futuristic within the company I worked for. Therefore I wanted to be the one thinking outside the box and evolving myself in a field that I think is the most powerful and most emerging area in the current era. </p>
